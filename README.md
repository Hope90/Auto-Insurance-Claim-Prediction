# Data Science Test
# Auto Insurance: Claim Prediction
## Goal
The aim of the project is to write a code which should be able to make a prediction on the dataset Auto Insurance.  
The target for this project is `TARGET_FLAG`.

The code should explicitly:  
* return the performance of the algorithms tested using the appropriate metric  
* explain with markdown comment important modelling decisions including metric selection  
* generate a csv file with the predictions  

Performance is **not** the main goal.  
The first objective of the project is to write the main steps of a data-science project with a **proper style** and **well written comments**.  
The algorithms used do not have to be hyper-optimized on all parameters. However, the project should test different algorithms adapted to the type of problem.  

## Data
train_auto  
test_auto

## Submission
The project should be shared via a github, gitlab or any other public git repository kept available until the end of the technical interview.  
Notebooks should be saved with outputs.
